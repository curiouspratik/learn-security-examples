Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The vulnerability in insecure.js stemmed from its permission for programmatically setting session
information due to the absence of cookie.httpOnly being set to false. This opened avenues for malicious
users to exploit session hijacking or execute Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
The secure version addresses this vulnerability by ensuring that cookie.httpOnly is set to true,
thereby restricting unauthorized access to session data and preventing potential attacks.
