Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
he vulnerability arises from sending the "name" property as an unsanitized string within the request, making it susceptible to cross-site scripting attacks. This allows attackers to manipulate the input and potentially compromise the security of the system. The secure version mitigates this vulnerability by sanitizing all properties and variables received in the request, preventing unauthorized manipulation.
